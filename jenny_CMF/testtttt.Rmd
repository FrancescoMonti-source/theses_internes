## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(grid)

# Create a ggplot object
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()

#Save the ggplot as an editable DrawingML vector graphic
editable_plot = dml(code = {print(p)})

body_add_gg("testtt.docx",value = p)
# Create a new PowerPoint document using officer
doc <- read_pptx()

# Add a slide and then add the editable ggplot to the slide
doc <- doc %>%
  add_slide(layout = "Title and Content", master = "Office Theme") %>%
  ph_with(value = editable_plot, location = ph_location_type(type = "body"))

# Save the PowerPoint document
print(doc, target = "test.pptx")
```
